        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          Nestled in the bustling yet peaceful neighborhood of Gyaneswor, Kathmandu, Pranav‚Äôs Cafe stands as a haven for those who appreciate good food, good vibes, and even better company. From the moment you walk in, you‚Äôre greeted by a blend of rustic charm and modern elegance ‚Äî a place where wooden textures meet greenery, and soft jazz hums in the background.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our caf√© isn‚Äôt just about food ‚Äî it's about connection. Every cup of coffee brewed, every pastry baked, and every salad tossed tells a story of local love, seasonal freshness, and sustainability. We prioritize health-conscious yet hearty recipes and offer plenty of vegan and gluten-free options without compromising on taste.
